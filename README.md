Project Idea

   In order to ensure that election results are honest and accurate we are developing an online open source Azure Blockchain Application   for voting, that provides transparency into election results by allowing voters to independently audit the ballot box. Using cutting edge  technologies, such as blockchain technology and elliptic curve cryptography,  we can actually accomplish this, all while protecting each voter’s right to privacy.
   By this application those citizens who are 18+ and don’t have voter id have option to vote from Aadhar card no.

  In this application user have two step procedure as follows 

1  First it will show two options to user to vote from voter id number or Aadhar number.
    then  this will verify if user is in voter id database or not.  
 2.If user select Aadhar no. option 


Vote Counting
  
   After verifying the user it will shows the list of candidates of his/her constituency then it will add the users vote to the selected candidate.

After the deadline of voting pole it will shows the winner of election. 

Thankyou.
