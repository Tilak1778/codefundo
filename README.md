Project Idea

   In order to ensure that election results are honest and accurate we are developing an online open source Azure Blockchain Application   for voting, that provides transparency into election results by allowing voters to independently audit the ballot box. Using cutting edge  technologies, such as blockchain technology and elliptic curve cryptography,  we can actually accomplish this, all while protecting each voter’s right to privacy.
   By this application those citizens who are 18+ and don’t have voter id will have option to vote from Aadhar card number.
   
   Also there would be a dead line before a user can register let us say 3 weeks before the elections. Candidates can vote from anywhere by selecting as general electors, overseas (NRI) electors or service electors.


  In this application user have two step procedure which is as follows 

1  First it will show two options to user either to vote from voter id number or Aadhar number, if user select voter id
    then  this will verify if user is in voter id database or not.  
 2.If user select Aadhar no. option then it will verify if user is eligible(above 18 years old) for vote or not.


Vote Counting
  
   After verifying the user it will show the list of candidates of his/her constituency then it will add the users vote to the selected candidate.

After the deadline of voting poll is over it will show the winner of election. 

Thank you.
